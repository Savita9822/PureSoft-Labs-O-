Here's a high-level overview of the steps:

1. Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript and App Router.
2. Design the dashboard UI based on the provided Figma design.
3. Fetch data from the JSON file and display it on the dashboard.
4. Implement the "Download" button functionality to send a POST request to the specified API endpoint.
5. Deploy the app to Vercel.

Here are the code snippets for each step:

Step 1: Create a new Next.js project

bash
npx create-next-app my-app --ts --app-router

Step 2: Design the dashboard UI

Create a new file components/Dashboard.tsx with the following code:

tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map(item => (
          <li key={(link unavailable)}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;

Step 3: Fetch data from the JSON file

Create a new file api/data.ts with the following code:

import fs from 'fs';

const getData = async () => {
  const jsonData = await fs.promises.readFile('data.json', 'utf8');
  return JSON.parse(jsonData);
};

export default getData;

Step 4: Implement the "Download" button functionality

Create a new file components/DownloadButton.tsx with the following code:

tsx
import axios from 'axios';

const DownloadButton = () => {
  const handleDownload = async () => {
    const response = await axios.post('(link unavailable)', {
      api: 'your_api_secret_here',
    });
    const imageData = response.data;
    const blob = new Blob([imageData], { type: 'image/jpeg' });
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = url;
    a.download = 'image.jpg';
    a.click();
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleDownload}>Download</button>
  );
};

export default DownloadButton;

Step 5: Deploy the app to Vercel

Create a new file vercel.json with the following code:

{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "next.config.js",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/dashboard",
      "dest": "pages/dashboard.tsx"
    }
  ]
}

Please note that you need to replace your_api_secret_here with the actual API secret value from the JSON file.

Also, make sure to create a new file next.config.js with the following code:

module.exports = {
  //...
};

This is just a basic configuration file for Next.js.

Once you've completed all the steps, you can deploy your app to Vercel by following these steps:

1. Create a new Vercel account if you haven't already.
2. Install the Vercel CLI by running npm install -g vercel in your terminal.
3. Run vercel in your terminal to deploy your app.
4. Follow the prompts to connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
5. Once the deployment is complete, you'll receive a shareable link to your app.

Please note that this is just a high-level overview of the steps, and you may need to modify the code snippets to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you'll need to make sure that you're complying with all the requirements specified in the task instructions.
